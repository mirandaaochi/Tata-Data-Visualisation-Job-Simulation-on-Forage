## Business Problem

An online retail store has hired you as a consultant to review their data and provide insights that would be valuable to the CEO and CMO of the business. The business has been performing well and the management wants to analyze what the major contributing factors are to the revenue so they can strategically plan for next year.

The leadership is interested in viewing the metrics from both an operations and marketing perspective. Management also intends to expand the business and is interested in seeking guidance into areas that are performing well so they can keep a clear focus on what’s working. They would also like to view different metrics based on the demographic information that is available in the data.

A meeting with the CEO and CMO has been scheduled for next month and you need to draft the relevant analytics and insights that would help evaluate the current business performance and suggest metrics that would enable them to make the decision on expansion.

**Task One: Learn how to anticipate the questions your business leaders will need answers to.**

You’ve been provided a dataset in the resources below to use as the basis for your exploration. Review this data, taking note of what information has been provided, what insights you can garner, and what is relevant to both the CEO and CMO respectively. 

Create a set of four questions that you anticipate each business leader will ask and want to know the answers to. Make sure you differentiate your questions, as both the CEO and CMO view business decisions through different lenses.

**Task 2 - Learn which visuals are most effective in a given scenario.**

You have been asked by the CEO and CMO to provide visuals on the metrics that they wish to analyze for the online retail store. You will gather the requirements and provide them with the type of visual that would be best suited to the scenario. The senior management wants to understand how their business is performing and what areas are the key strengths of the company. They are also focused on identifying opportunities that would lead to growth and generate more revenue in the future.

You will be provided multiple visualization requests by the CEO and you would need to provide the visual which would explain the data and insights in the simplest possible manner. The visual should adequately convey the information that you are trying to present. This exercise is critical to the senior management as any incorrect representation can lead to a wrong message being conveyed, or a wrong decision taken by the management. Therefore, you would need to make sure that the correct visuals are used to represent each set of data.

**Task 3 - Apply your under and create visuals based on business scenarios.**

The CEO and CMO have recently met to finalize the requirements and would like you to provide them with some analysis and visuals that would help answer their questions. Both, the executives are interested in viewing and understanding how they can use the data to make more meaningful decisions. You would need to provide insights which they can use to create the expansion strategy. The executives want to analyze the trends and the breakdown by different categories so that they have clarity on how the revenue is being generated and what are the main factors affecting the online store.

You will be provided with the requirements of the executives and how they want to view the data. After the requirement gathering phase, you would need to make sure that the data you are using is of good quality and does not contain any bad data that would have an adverse impact on your analysis. Once the data is cleaned, the next step would be to create the visuals on either Tableau or Power BI. No matter which tool you choose for the visuals, the result should be the same. These results will help the executives with effective decision making and assist in their expansion strategy.

**Task 4 - Effectively communicate your findings and explain how it relates to each scenario.**

It’s time to present your findings to the CEO and CMO. They are interested in your thought process and how you have handled the data cleanup and visualization phase. It is important to explain your thought process and ideas in a clear and straightforward way. You are also required to clearly present the analysis of all four questions from the previous task. Make sure you are well versed with the data and the conclusions you’ve made from your analysis.

## Results and Business Recommendations

[Tableau Public Visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/views/TataForageTask3_17157256875080/Question1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

**Question 1: The CEO of the retail store is interested to view the time series of the revenue data for the year 2011 only. He would like to view granular data by looking into revenue for each month. The CEO is interested in viewing the seasonal trends and wants to dig deeper into why these trends occur. This analysis will be helpful for the CEO to forecast for the next year.**

![Question 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c27f886-5b72-4d0b-8eb8-df465ff0695f)

Based on this line chart, we see that revenue was highest in November and lowest in February. Seasonally, we see revenue really start to pick up in the fall, peaking in November before falling in December. We also see fluctuation in the beginning of the year.

**Question 2: The CMO is interested in viewing the top 10 countries which are generating the highest revenue. Additionally, the CMO is also interested in viewing the quantity sold along with the revenue generated. The CMO does not want to have the United Kingdom in this visual.**

![Question 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d64e3a1d-f376-4f53-b4d9-8c224c056d9d)

Using this side-by-side chart, we see that based on revenue, the top 10 countries (excluding the UK) are:
Netherlands
EIRE (Ireland)
Germany
France
Australia
Spain
Switzerland
Belgium
Sweden
Japan

**Question 3: The CMO of the online retail store wants to view the information on the top 10 customers by revenue. He is interested in a visual that shows the greatest revenue generating customer at the start and gradually declines to the lower revenue generating customers. The CMO wants to target the higher revenue generating customers and ensure that they remain satisfied with their products.**

![Question 3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b167d9d5-0af8-4ae9-94e5-f8805d1e626a)

To answer this, we’ve created a column chart that calculated the total revenue from each Customer ID. Excluding customers without Customer IDs, these are the top 10 customers by revenue. The customer with the greatest revenue has spent $280,206. The customer in the number 10 spot has only spent a total of $77,184.

**Question 4: The CEO is looking to gain insights on the demand for their products. He wants to look at all countries and see which regions have the greatest demand for their products. Once the CEO gets an idea of the regions that have high demand, he will initiate an expansion strategy which will allow the company to target these areas and generate more business from these regions. He wants to view the entire data on a single view without the need to scroll or hover over the data points to identify the demand. There is no need to show data for the United Kingdom as the CEO is more interested in viewing the countries that have expansion opportunities.**

![Question 4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/612fc657-8e74-41ce-a9e6-10bbe2816d42)

The majority of demand comes from European countries. However, if you recall our top 10, Australia and Japan are also up there. Hong Kong and Singapore have significant demand, but there isn’t really demand in the rest of Asia. Additionally, the demand in the U.S. and Canada is relatively low in comparison. There’s also relatively low demand in Brazil, South Africa, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.
